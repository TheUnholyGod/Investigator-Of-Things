    at the presumed time of murder so she has an alibi, just need to verify it.\r\nB:
    Aalrigh, how about corporate interests?\r\nP: There were signs of tampering in
    the system, like someone was trying to frame someone else.\r\nB: So we should
    look into this then?\r\nP: Not in the way you think sir. The tampering was very
    basic almost like it was someone\u2019s first attempt at such a thing. Not someone
    who\u2019d be trained for it.\r\nP: And what was interesting is whoever did this
    tried to frame our chem addicted suspect.\r\nBut as I said. The forgery was not
